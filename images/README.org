#+TITLE:Ada/SPARK support for Emacs org-babel

* Hello world example

No explanation needed:

* Hello world with literal variables

=org-babel= can also be used to write literate programming code. =ob-ada-spark=
adds the possibility to create /literal variables/ in the =header= that are not
only literally substituted, but also evaluated, and replaced in the source code
before evaluation.

For example, it would be possible to write ~__TIMES__=(/ 4 2)~ instead of only
~2~.

A more complex example would be:
#+begin_example
  __Path__=(file-name-directory (buffer-file-name (current-buffer)))
#+end_example

* SPARK prove

SPARK code can be evaluated and proved. Evaluation is the default action when
=Ctrl-C Ctrl-C= is pressed. Add =:prove t= to prove SPARK code:
